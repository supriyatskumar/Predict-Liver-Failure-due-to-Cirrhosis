# Predict-Liver-Failure-due-to-Cirrhosis

### Problem Statement
Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. Advanced cirrhosis results in Liver failure and may be life threatening. Early detection of liver cirrhosis can be treated and reduce further damage. 

This project is to predict liver failure due to cirrhosis using demographic and personal health variables. 

### Use cases
* This can be used to gain insight on how social determinants and individiual determinants of health contributes to liver failure due to cirrhosis. As a result, it can be used by government or non-profit entities to promote public health.
* This can be used by insurance providers to predict health behaviours and outcomes of their members and enable new methods of connecting them to social and environmental services to help treat, prevent and cure medical conditions, improve quality of life and, reduce overall medical costs.

The data set consists of selected information from 8,785 adults 20 years of age or older taken from the 2008–2009 and 2014–2015 surveys.

## Machine Learning Problem Statement 
This is a binary classification problem, where given the demographic and personal health variables, predict if a given patient will have liver failure or not.
